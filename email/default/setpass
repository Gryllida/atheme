&accountname&,

Someone has requested that the password on your account be recovered,
and sent to the e-mail address on file.  If you did not request this
change it was likely an innocent mistake but you may wish to
change your password anyway.

In order to set a new password, you must send the following command
on IRC, where <password> is the new password you wish to set.

   /msg &nicksvs& SETPASS &accountname& &param& <password>
